The lessons are entertaining, but they remain very superficial. It's more like rote memorization than real understanding.",

Based on my learning experience, I can therefore recommend the following books:",

The further back the vocabulary is, the less often it gets tested. This way you repeat difficult vocabulary often and easy vocabulary only rarely – until they finally land in the last compartment and are considered \"almost learned\".",

I no longer wanted to just walk through the streets and imagine what my everyday life could look like – I wanted to see real options. The next logical step: searching for a suitable apartment.",
      "paragraph2": "But before you even start browsing listings, you should know the basics. One of the most important prerequisites is the NIE (Número de Identificación de Extranjero). This is basically the Spanish tax number for foreigners, without which you can neither open a bank account nor buy a property. Speaking of bank accounts: Although a good gestoría can help you work around a lot, in the end there's almost no way around opening a Spanish account.",

Then it was off to the apartment. In the end, it wasn't much different from a rental viewing in Germany: walking through, asking questions, and trying to imagine everyday life there. And honestly, I usually knew within the first 30 to 40 seconds whether it could work or not. This gut feeling rarely deceived me."

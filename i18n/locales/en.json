I didn't want to be one of those \"emigrants\" who have been living in Spain for years but still can barely put together a sentence in Spanish. So it was clear to me: I have to learn Spanish."

The lessons are entertaining, but they remain very superficial. It's more like rote memorization than real understanding.",

Based on my learning experience, I can therefore recommend the following books:",

Each chapter first covers the theory (e.g., tenses, pronouns, sentence structure) and then offers exercises and vocabulary lists. Additionally, there is online material for listening comprehension tasks.",
              "review": "Super helpful for the initial start in Spanish. The book brings you closer to your first own sentences step by step. I particularly liked the combination of theory, exercises, and vocabulary – it strongly reminds me of school lessons, just more compact. With the online listening comprehension tasks, I could also directly train speaking and understanding. All in all, exactly what you need to be able to communicate a little in everyday life."

When you know a vocabulary word during testing, it moves one compartment further back. If you don't know it, it goes back to the very front in the first compartment. The further back the vocabulary is, the less often it gets tested. This way you repeat difficult vocabulary often and easy vocabulary only rarely – until they finally land in the last compartment and are considered \"almost learned\".",

      "paragraph2": "Spanish offices, foreign language, endless documents – that sounded like stress at first. But the fact is: Without this step, the dream of your own home in Spain remains just a dream.",

      "paragraph2": "The application is handled by the Policía Nacional. Appointments are available online, sometimes also spontaneously on site – with a lot of luck. Realistically, you have to expect waiting times of several weeks.",
      "paragraph3": "Since I didn't have the opportunity to constantly lurk for free appointments in Spain, I commissioned a service provider: Spanieninfo (spanieninfo.biz). They handle the application for you if you sign a power of attorney at a German notary and make it valid for Spain with an apostille.",
      "tip": "My tip: Take care of it in time, preferably before you find your dream apartment. Without NIE, you can't even take the first step in the purchase.",

      "paragraph2": "The choice is great: from Santander to CaixaBank to Bankinter, many banks offer special accounts for foreigners. What you need is relatively clear: your NIE, passport and – if you want to deposit equity immediately – proof of the origin of the money.",
      "paragraph3": "I myself opted for an account as a non-resident. It costs a bit more, but it's the simplest solution for everyone who doesn't live permanently in Spain.",
      "tip": "I opened my account quite late with the help of my gestoría – it worked just in time, but I would recommend doing it much earlier.",

      "paragraph2": "So the Spanish banks remain: Santander, Bankinter, CaixaBank and many others. However, the conditions are stricter for non-residents: usually maximum 70% financing, stricter credit checks and higher interest rates.",
      "paragraph3": "In my case, my real estate agency offered me a partner who was supposed to accompany the entire financing process – but for a hefty 4,000 € fee. I declined and researched myself instead.",

      "paragraph2": "The weeks between preliminary contract and notary appointment were by far the most stressful time of my life. You already have a lot of money in the project – and know that you can lose it if you miss a deadline or a document is missing.",
      "paragraph3": "I ended up quite randomly at Gestoría Carrasco & Fischer in Orihuela Costa – and was looked after top from day one. They explained the Contrato de Arras to me, translated the contracts, took over communication with the bank and accompanied me to the notary.",
      "paragraph4": "Alternatively (or additionally), you can also hire a lawyer for real estate law. They mainly check whether the property is legally clean: no open legal disputes, no illegal constructions, no nasty surprises. Costs more, but provides security. I myself refrained from doing so – also because I had already signed the Contrato de Arras in a rush.",
      "tip": "Without a gestoría, I would probably have lost my mind during the purchase process. A gestoría is an office that guides you through all the bureaucracy in Spain – from taxes to contracts to re-registration of electricity and water. The investment in professional help was the best decision for me after buying the apartment itself.",

              "description": "A clearly structured beginner's book that starts from zero and teaches the basics step by step. Each chapter first covers the theory (e.g., tenses, pronouns, sentence structure) and then offers exercises and vocabulary lists. Additionally, there is online material for listening comprehension tasks.",
              "review": "Super helpful for the initial start in Spanish. The book brings you closer to your first own sentences step by step. I particularly liked the combination of theory, exercises, and vocabulary – it strongly reminds me of school lessons, just more compact. With the online listening comprehension tasks, I could also directly train speaking and understanding. All in all, exactly what you need to be able to communicate a little in everyday life."

              "review": "Every now and then I wanted to check how my Spanish skills were doing – and for that, the book is great. You quickly notice that you're having small successes, and through the audio files you can additionally train your listening comprehension."

Through the physical act of writing them down, the words become much more deeply ingrained than through mere reading. Additionally, the system helped me stay on track – I always had a clear structure and knew exactly which vocabulary I had to repeat on which day. This helped me stay continuously engaged and track my learning progress. In short:",

            "systemDescription": "You have a box with 6 compartments. New vocabulary always starts in the first compartment. When you know a vocabulary word during testing, it moves one compartment further back. If you don't know it, it goes back to the very front in the first compartment. The further back the vocabulary is, the less often it gets tested. This way you repeat difficult vocabulary often and easy vocabulary only rarely – until they finally land in the last compartment and are considered \"almost learned\".",

    "title": "Gestor√≠a ‚Äì Help in the Bureaucratic Jungle",
    "content": "As you've already read, the Gestor√≠a took care of a lot of the organization and bureaucracy for me. I want to give you a brief overview of why I ultimately decided on a Gestor√≠a ‚Äì and not on a real estate lawyer ‚Äì and exactly what they handled for me."

    "title": "Why a Gestor√≠a and not a lawyer?",
    "intro": "Or why not both, some might ask. In fact, the tasks of both parties only partially overlap.",
    "gestoria": {
      "title": "Gestor√≠a",
      "description": "A Gestor√≠a is basically an office for administration and processing. They take care of applications to authorities, taxes, registrations and all organizational processes related to property purchase. You can think of them as a mix of tax advisor and administrative assistant who work very close to practice."
    },
    "lawyer": {
      "title": "Real Estate Lawyer",
      "description": "A lawyer primarily examines the legal side of the purchase ‚Äì e.g. whether everything in the land register is correct, whether the contract contains clauses that could disadvantage you, or whether there are any environmental liabilities. In case of doubt, they are also liable for incorrect advice."
    },
    "costs": {
      "title": "üí∂ Costs",
      "content": "While a Gestor√≠a usually costs around 500‚Äì1,500 ‚Ç¨ for the complete processing, a specialized lawyer often charges 150‚Äì250 ‚Ç¨ per hour or a flat fee of 2,000‚Äì3,000 ‚Ç¨. Both together is of course the safest option, but quickly exceeds the budget."
    },
    "conclusion": "I had never heard of a Gestor√≠a before my purchase and initially only kept a lawyer in reserve. But it wasn't until I was about to sink into chaos after signing the Contrato de Arras (down payment and preliminary contract) that I came across Gestor√≠a Carrasco through Google. And they helped me so well that I didn't need the lawyer anymore. The risks we discussed together were manageable, and for me the price-performance ratio clearly outweighed everything else."

        "title": "Review of the Contrato de Arras",
        "description": "I had already signed when the Gestor√≠a came on board. Fortunately, it was a standard contract from Redpiso that complied with all legal requirements and didn't harm me."

      "step2": {
        "title": "Cost Overview",
        "description": "Before it really started, I received an estimate of the additional costs (taxes, notary, land register, etc.) so I knew how much money I needed to have ready."

        "title": "Review of the Purchase Contract",
        "description": "The actual purchase contract was checked for correctness and explained to me in German. I also got the tip to demand an official transfer receipt for every payment ‚Äì very valuable!"

      "step4": {
        "title": "Power of Attorney at the Notary",
        "description": "On the recommendation of the Gestor√≠a, I gave them power of attorney. This way they could carry out all further steps in my name without me having to constantly fly to Spain. That was worth its weight in gold."
      },
      "step5": {
        "title": "Bank Account Opening",
        "description": "Since transfers from Germany are often not accepted, the Gestor√≠a opened a Spanish account for me. The purchase price, taxes and ongoing ancillary costs all went through this account."
      },
      "step6": {
        "title": "Document Collection",
        "description": "They requested all necessary documents from the seller: property tax statement, ongoing electricity and water bills, energy certificate, proof of mortgage, etc. ‚Äì without which there would be no notary appointment."

      "step7": {
        "title": "Preparation and Review of the Escritura",
        "description": "The Escritura is the final purchase deed that is signed at the notary. The Gestor√≠a reviewed the document in detail, sent me a translation and asked for my consent. Even when the originally planned notary dropped out at short notice, they found a replacement within a day."

      "step8": {
        "title": "Representation at the Notary",
        "description": "On the day of signing, the Gestor√≠a sat for me at the notary, completed the purchase cleanly, received the keys and kept them in their office until I could pick them up personally."

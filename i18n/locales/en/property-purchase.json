    "viewing": {
      "title": "The Viewing",
      "content1": "When I first saw the apartment online, I immediately had this gut feeling: \"This could be it.\" The photos showed white marble-effect tiles, a large window front with a view of a plaza, a modern bathroom with a walk-in shower â€“ everything freshly renovated, plus a price that was hard to believe. And all of this right in the pedestrian zone, where everything would be within walking distance. I wrote directly to the agent.",
      "content2": "At first there was no response. Only after several follow-ups did I learn that the apartment was already reserved. That disappointed me â€“ especially since the listing had only been online for a few days and I had reacted quickly from the start. Still, the apartment wouldn't let me go. After about three weeks, I wrote again â€“ this time it suddenly said: \"You can come by tomorrow.\"",
      "content3": "Of course I was immediately nervous. I told Emely about it, and we talked about it at length the evening before. She was just as excited as I was, and we went through all the scenarios together: What if it really becomes this apartment? Actually, it was clear to both of us: As long as no serious defects appear during the viewing, this will be our apartment.",
      "content4": "So the next day we set off. First we had a short appointment in the office of the Redpiso agent. As usual, I was told there that in case of a purchase, the agent's commission of 3% of the purchase price is to be borne by the buyer. That was already known to me from other viewings, so nothing new. Then we walked together to the apartment â€“ just a few minutes on foot.",
      "content5": "The moment I unlocked the door was decisive for me. The apartment looked even better than in the pictures. The light through the large window front, the well-maintained condition, the new built-in wardrobes â€“ everything fit. No obvious defects, no renovation site in sight. We went systematically through every room, Emely and I were already thinking about how to use the rooms, and I checked off my prepared checklist. In the end, only the most important question remained: \"If I want the apartment â€“ what happens now?\""

    "arrasContract": {
      "title": "The Contrato de Arras",
      "content1": "The agent explained to me that the next step would be the so-called Contrato de Arras. This is a preliminary contract with which the buyer shows their binding interest through a down payment. At the same time, a deadline is agreed within which the main purchase contract must be signed.",
      "content2": "Common in Spain is the variant of \"arras penitenciales\": If the buyer backs out without reason, the down payment is lost. If the seller backs out, they must pay back double.",
      "content3": "In my case, this meant: â‚¬3,000 down payment and 30 days deadline to sign the purchase contract. I have to admit: I signed this contract the same evening after the viewing â€“ in retrospect, rushed. The reason: According to the agent, there were already more viewings the next day, and I was only the second interested party. The first had reserved the apartment, but their financing had failed. It was clear to me: If I hesitate, I could lose the chance. So I signed.",
      "warning": "My advice today: Only take this step if you're really sure and your documents and financing are largely in place."
    },
    "purchaseContract": {
      "title": "The Purchase Contract",
      "content1": "The actual purchase contract was a much more extensive document. Here all rights and obligations for buyer and seller were detailed. It also gave me 90 days to complete the purchase at the notary. Before signing, I naturally had the contract checked by my gestorÃ­a â€“ everything was in order.",
      "content2": "With the signing of this contract, however, I had to transfer another â‚¬11,000. That was no small step, because at the same time my financing was not yet fully secured. So I had to decide: Do I go full risk â€“ or not?",
      "content3": "For me it was clear: This apartment fit perfectly with my ideas, so I signed."

      "title": "Between Purchase Contract and Notary Appointment",
      "content1": "After signing, a phase of exactly 90 days began. Actually, I could have been at the notary after about 50 days, but the seller insisted on using the full deadline. That made me suspicious at first â€“ especially since the agent had told me before that he needed the money for another investment.",
      "content2": "In these weeks, my gestorÃ­a practically took care of everything: communication with the seller's side, collecting documents, clarifying electricity and water contracts, opening a Spanish bank account (through which the purchase price and ancillary costs later ran). I had given them a notarial power of attorney for this â€“ a step I recommend to everyone. This way you don't have to travel to Spain yourself for every detail.",
      "content3": "But it didn't run completely smoothly: some documents came very late or had to be requested multiple times, responses from the agent were often missing. Without gestorÃ­a, that would have been hardly manageable for me."

      "content2": "I myself was not on site â€“ the gestorÃ­a represented me. On site it was a hectic appointment: many people, lots of paper, discussions with the seller's side, and the bank representative initially came without the right power of attorney to cancel the seller's mortgage. But in the end everything went smoothly.",

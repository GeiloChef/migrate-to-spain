After my first positive experiences on site, it is clear to me that this is the path I want to take in the long term.

    "content": "First and foremost is the question of my work. It is not yet finally clarified how I can reconcile my profession with a life in Spain. But even if a perfect solution is found for this, there are further bureaucratic hurdles: applying for residency, registering with social security, and clarifying my tax obligations as a resident. All processes that will require time, patience, and certainly professional support again."

Until then, it's about: maintaining patience, gaining experience – and above all, continuing to learn Spanish, because that will be indispensable in the future."

    "title": "Why insurance is so important",
    "content": "During the purchase process, it was clear to me that I absolutely wanted to secure my apartment well. With a mortgage in Spain, you are often forced to take out insurance directly through the bank - at least if you want to benefit from lower interest rates. In many cases, the bank even specifies what and how must be insured. After all, it doesn't want to risk losing its capital in an emergency. Since I financed the apartment completely myself, I could freely decide with whom and how to secure myself. Following the motto: Freedom or agony of choice - because the selection of policies is huge."

    "content": "While in Germany you take out household contents, building and often liability insurance separately, in Spain much is bundled in a single package, the Seguro de Hogar.

Finding the right offer was the biggest hurdle - the processing afterwards went quickly and smoothly. From the day of the notary appointment, I was secured, come what may."

  "conclusion": {
    "title": "My conclusion",

The property itself gives you a roof over your head, but the insurance ensures that you can sleep peacefully - whether you are currently in Spain or on the other side of the world. And above all: Don't take the first offer from the bank, but compare thoroughly. This way you ensure that everything you need is really covered."

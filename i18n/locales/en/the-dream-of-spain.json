Spain has always appealed to me – many warm days a year, an open and warm culture, endless sandy beaches, but also mountainous landscapes for hiking. Everything I longed for while sitting in a cold office in Germany or looking out the window on gray weekends.",

        "paragraph2": "And at this point my decision was firm: I wanted to find a way to live in Spain. Not just because of sun and prices – but because I saw the chance to live more simply and carefree there.",

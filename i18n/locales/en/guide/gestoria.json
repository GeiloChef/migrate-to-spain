            "answer": "Yes, with power of attorney (poder notarial). The Gestoría can then handle all steps for you: book appointment, fill out forms, pay fees, and collect the NIE. Without power of attorney, you must appear in person. The power of attorney must be notarized or authenticated with apostille."

            "answer": "No, for most administrative processes, a Gestoría is completely sufficient. They specialize in applications, deadlines, and bureaucratic matters. You only need a lawyer for legal disputes, contract negotiations, or complex legal problems. For NIE, Empadronamiento, tax forms, etc., the Gestoría is the right choice."

            "question": "How long does it take?",
            "answer": "This depends strongly on the region and authority. A good Gestoría communicates realistic timeframes and dependencies to you. Example property purchase: notary appointment (1-2 weeks) → tax payment (immediately) → Registro entry (2-4 weeks) → Catastro update (1-2 weeks). For NIE: often 1-2 weeks, sometimes immediately. A professional Gestoría keeps you informed about all steps."

          "language": {
            "question": "Do Gestorías also speak German or English?",
            "answer": "Many only speak Spanish, but there are also Gestorías with German or English skills. Ask directly: \"¿Habla alemán/inglés?\" If not, bring a translator or work in writing via email - this is often clearer and better documented. Some Gestorías also work with translation services."
          },
          "online_later": {
            "question": "Can I handle many things online myself later?",
            "answer": "Yes, with the Digital Certificate (FNMT) you can handle many administrative tasks online: tax returns, applications, appointment bookings. Many Gestorías help with setting up the digital certificate. Once set up, you save time and money on future matters. The Gestoría can also show you how to handle certain processes online yourself."
